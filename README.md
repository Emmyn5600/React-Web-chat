# simple web chat.

> simple web chat is a format that allows customers/users to communicate directly with brands online, often on their websites. The web chat window pops up to add the users as an overlay of the website page in the browser, allowing the user to type messages directly into a text field. the users and mesages are kept in the local storage because there isn't backend developed so far.

You have to add two users (X and Y), when X sends a message the color should be gray and if Y sends the message the color should be red with their corresponding names.
